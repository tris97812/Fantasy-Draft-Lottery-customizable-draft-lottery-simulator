# Fantasy-Draft-Lottery-customizable-simulator
A customizable NBA-style draft lottery simulator for your Fantasy League. 

The simulator is based on the "real" NBA lottery. You can use the lottery simulator to make your fantasy league more fun.

Before I created this little tool, I did our yearly lottery for my 14 Team Points League "offline".
I wrote the numbers 1-14 on 14 little cheats and put them in a glas.
Then I took 4 cheats out (without putting them in again after I chose 1 cheat)
4 cheats/numbers were 1 ticket.
I simulated an excel-cheat with 1000 tickets. 
The Teams with the best odds for the No1-Pick (in our league the 3 best teams that didn't make the playoffs) had the most tickets (140 tickets each) like in the real NBA lottery.
After picking the numbers I had to search in the excel cheat for the ticket and the team name.

With this little tool I don't have to look in the excel cheat no more because the computer does it for me.

So if you want to use this tool, you can either choose "offline lottery" or "online lottery" first.
offline lottery means, that you write the numbers 1-14 on 14 little cheats and pick the numbers manually.
online lottery means, that the computer randomizes this process.

Afterwards you can choose the number of teams of your league and put the team/manager names in.
Then you can adjust the ticket number for each team (it has to add up to 1000 tickets total).
